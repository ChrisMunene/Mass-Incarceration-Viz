                <strong>Mass incarceration is one of the most jarring realities of the
                    United States</strong>--the US holds one quarter of the world’s incarcerated
                population, while it only constitutes 5% of the global population.
                The practice of imprisoning socioeconomic and racial minorities, as
                well as other specific groups, stems from a harsh and complex
                history of racial discrimination unique to the United States, whose
                infrastructure and economy originally emerged from slavery, and in
                which under the 13th Amendment, involuntary servitude is only
                permissible in the context of jail. This history has transformed
                into an equally complex modern reality, in which demographics are
                jailed in varying patterns, for varying reasons, across different
                regions of the US. These visualizations aim to expose trends in
                incarceration via a number of those factors, and then more
                specifically address the role of educational institutions and their
                punitive systems in feeding the prison-industrial complex.

                <h4>The School to Prison Pipeline</h4>

                <p>
                    The ACLU describes the “school-to-prison pipeline” as a national
                    trend in which youth are funneled out of schools into juvenile and
                    criminal justice systems. Especially affected are students with
                    learning disabilities, and children from minority and
                    disadvantaged groups, including racial minorities and children who
                    grew up in poverty. These scatterplots demonstrate the
                    correlations between county-wide incarceration rates and
                    disability, and incarceration rates and punitive or disciplinary
                    methods used in county schools, including suspension, expulsion,
                    and corporal punishment. These graphs additionally expose
                    variation in strength of correlation between races [WILL HAVE
                    DIFFERENT/ADDITIONAL TEXT AS THESE GRAPHS ARE COMPLETE AND WE KNOW

                <p>
                    “When children attend schools that place a greater value on
                    discipline and security than on knowledge and intellectual
                    development, they are attending prep schools for prison”
